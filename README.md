# Real Japanese Housewives of LA – Concept Overview

## Format & Tone
- **Genre:** scripted reality-parody short-form designed for YouTube (7–15 minutes per episode).
- **Vibe:** high-gloss Real Housewives energy filtered through anime-style exaggeration—playful confessionals, splashy transitions, and tongue-in-cheek narration.
- **Intent:** lampoon reality tropes while still chasing sincere emotional beats; glam spectacle meets earnest friendship drama.

## Ensemble Cast
1. **Reina Sato** – Old-money Beverly Hills tastemaker obsessed with etiquette; struggles to loosen up for the algorithm.
2. **Mika “Miko” Tan** – Pop-up beauty mogul who treats brunch like a product launch; power-dresser with ruthless polish.
3. **Aya Fujimoto** – Art curator and nightlife insider who moonlights as the show’s snarky narrator.
4. **Yumi Aizawa** – Spiritual wellness creator delivering viral meditations while hiding a competitive streak.
5. **Hana “Haze” Morimoto** – Effortlessly cool stoner lifestyle vlogger whose cosmic advice sometimes solves (or worsens) conflicts.

## Setting
- Beverly Hills rooftops, Venice Beach smoke-friendly patios, Little Tokyo karaoke lounges, boutique studios, and luxe pop-ups.
- Occasional split-screen LA↔Tokyo calls to highlight cross-Pacific ties and familial expectations.

## Stylistic Hooks
- Anime-inspired confessionals, chibi reaction overlays, and faux episode recap cards.
- Heightened sound design (whooshes, sparkle stings) to accent comedy beats.
- Each short features a self-contained social scenario that escalates into melodrama before resolving with a wink to camera.
