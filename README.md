# Real Japanese Housewives of LA – Concept Overview

## Format & Tone
- **Genre:** scripted reality-parody short-form designed for YouTube (7–15 minutes per episode).
- **Vibe:** high-gloss Real Housewives energy filtered through anime-style exaggeration—playful confessionals, splashy transitions, and tongue-in-cheek narration.
- **Intent:** lampoon reality tropes while still chasing sincere emotional beats; glam spectacle meets earnest friendship drama.

## Ensemble Cast
1. **Reina Sato – “Protocol Princess”**: Beverly Hills-born/Kyoto-trained etiquette guru whose polished shoots spiral when chaos (and Jiyeon’s critique) strikes; arc pushes her to embrace imperfection and share spotlight.
2. **Mika “Miko” Tan – “Boss of the Pop-Up”**: Cosmetic chemist with a roaming beauty lab; metrics-first mindset ignites turf wars until the charity cook-off forces her to mentor and collaborate.
3. **Aya Fujimoto – “Gallery Gossip”**: Art curator/nightlife insider serving razor-sharp commentary; her secret-hoarding fuels the rumor montage before a heart-to-heart with Hyejin softens her outlook.
4. **Yumi Aizawa – “Zen Hustler”**: Wellness/ASMR creator whose serene brand cracks under competitive pressure; learns to co-create mindful content with Minseo after the shopping showdown.
5. **Hana “Haze” Morimoto – “High Vibe Wild Card”**: Stoner lifestyle vlogger and skater connector; initially seen as flaky, she becomes the intuitive bridge between the LA crew, the Seoul Sisterhood, and the Daruma Diaries project.

### Guest Ensemble – Seoul Sisterhood
- **Jiyeon Park** – luxe K-beauty CEO whose blunt feedback triggers the midseason Reina/Mika breakup.
- **Hyejin Cho** – ex-idol turned lifestyle host who bonds with Aya over media burnout and rumor fallout.
- **Minseo Kang** – real estate rainmaker scouting LA; her late-night talk with Hana reveals shared family expectations and seeds crossover collabs.

## Setting
- Beverly Hills rooftops, Venice Beach smoke-friendly patios, Little Tokyo karaoke lounges, boutique studios, and luxe pop-ups.
- Occasional split-screen LA↔Tokyo calls to highlight cross-Pacific ties and familial expectations.

## Stylistic Hooks
- Anime-inspired confessionals, chibi reaction overlays, and faux episode recap cards.
- Heightened sound design (whooshes, sparkle stings) to accent comedy beats.
- Each short features a self-contained social scenario that escalates into melodrama before resolving with a wink to camera.
