# Real Japanese Housewives of LA – Show Bible Snapshot

## Series Premise
A short-form scripted parody that mimics prestige reality TV through an anime lens. Each 7–15 minute episode tracks the high-gloss lives of five Japanese/Japanese-American women in LA, mixing faux-confessional comedy with surprisingly heartfelt beats.

## Creative Pillars
1. **Heightened Reality:** Real Housewives structure (taglines, confessionals, glam squads) reimagined with anime reaction shots, on-screen chibi graphics, and splashy sound cues.
2. **Earnest Emotion:** Even when jokes land fast, episodes resolve with genuine reflections about friendship, culture clash, and reinvention.
3. **YouTube-Native Rhythm:** Cold opens, hooks, ad-break bait, and algorithm-friendly pacing keep the audience bingeing.

## Season Arc Overview
- **Episodes 1–3:** Introduce ensemble, hint at old rivalries, stage a blow-up at Reina’s rooftop tea.
- **Episodes 4–6:** Personal quests collide—brand launches, collabs, visa anxieties. Hana reluctantly becomes peacemaker.
- **Episodes 7–8:** Joint charity pop-up forces teamwork; secrets surface in confessionals. Finale tees up expanded universe trips.

## Visual Language
- Split-screen LA↔Tokyo calls, neon kanji lower-thirds, handheld docu moments contrasted with buttery glam interviews.
- Color palette: Beverly Hills pearl, neon magenta, temple red, jade green accent.

## Tropes & Signature Episodes
- **Confessional Chibi Mode:** Deformed avatars highlight spicy quotes in every interview (evergreen stylistic device).
- **Shopping Trip Spectacular:** Rodeo Drive takeover where budgets, alliances, and personal style clash—sets up festival looks.
- **Festival Night:** Summer matsuri pop-up in Little Tokyo sparks fireworks, literal and emotional.
- **Rumor-Spreading Montage:** Gossip sequences use animated text chains drifting across stylized LA skylines, escalating post-festival fallout.
- **Midseason Friendship Breakup:** Formal “we are on a break” declaration framed like a shoujo breakup.
- **Hot Springs Truth Circle:** Day trip to a private onsen resort near LA (or immersive spa set) as a guided attempt at reconciliation.
- **Beach Episode:** Venice/Malibu getaway doubles as faux retreat, leaning into dramatic sunlit confessionals once tempers cool.
- **Cooking Duel:** Gourmet collab devolves into iron-chef parody with branded bento judging—charity tie-in to prove unity.
- **Finale Showcase:** Charity gala/live stream that forces everyone back together for reconciliations and cliffhangers.

## Guest Ensemble – Seoul Sisterhood
- Midseason stunt crossover with “Seoul Sisterhood,” an aspirational Korean housewives collective visiting LA for a cosmetics summit.
- Cast: Jiyeon (luxury K-beauty CEO), Hyejin (ex-idol lifestyle host), Minseo (real estate rainmaker). They challenge and mirror the LA crew’s dynamics.
- Arc progression: sparks fly during Shopping Trip and Festival Night, but a late-night heart-to-heart/confessional swap reveals shared pressures. Rumor Montage exposes mutual vulnerabilities, leading to a temporary truce.
- Finale tag hints at a cross-Pacific continuation or sister series, keeping the door open for Season 2 or a spin-off.

## Season-Long C Plot – "Daruma Diaries"
- Reina gifts the group an unpainted daruma doll representing their shared goal to launch the channel without imploding.
- Each episode features a mini beat where the daruma swaps hands, gets new accessories, or becomes part of someone’s ritual (Hana straps it to her board, Mika uses it as KPIs mascot, etc.).
- Finale moment: second eye gets filled during the live stream after the crews reconcile, symbolizing collective growth and future crossovers.

## Delivery
- Weekly drops on YouTube + companion shorts (tagline teasers, confessionals outtakes).
